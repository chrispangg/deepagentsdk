## Hey there

I'm starting this blog to document what I'm learning while building Deep Agents. I'll be writing about:

- How the architecture actually works (and why certain decisions were made)
- Practical patterns I've found useful
- New features as they get added
- Things that work well (and things that don't)

## What are Deep Agents?

Deep Agents are a way to build more capable AI agents by combining four key capabilities:

1. **Planning tools** - Agents can break down tasks and track progress with `write_todos`
2. **Virtual filesystem** - Persistent file operations that work across multiple tool calls
3. **Subagent spawning** - Delegate specialized work to focused sub-agents
4. **Detailed prompting** - Clear system prompts that help agents understand what they can do

This is based on LangChain's DeepAgents framework, reimplemented for Vercel AI SDK v6.

## Get Started

If you want to try it out, the [Getting Started guide](/docs/get-started) walks through the basics, or you can check out the [examples](https://github.com/chrispangg/ai-sdk-deepagent/tree/main/examples) to see it in action.
